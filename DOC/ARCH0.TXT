Questions About the Mainframe Emulation Product
{What response does it give to a STIDP instruction?
{How does it deviate in behaviour from the description
 of that model found in the applicable IBM 

{What execution modes are available?
{Basic Control (360)?
{Extended Control (370)?

{ESA?
{For each of these modes, what limitations are there from IBM
\rquote s published specifications?
{Do you emulate channels?  
what deviations and limitations does this emulation have?
{Do you emulate expanded store?
{Do you emulate dataspaces?
{Is the emulated real memory lkmited to the size of native physical memory,
or can it be virtualized?
{Do you emulate disks at the device level,
 the driver level, or file level?
{What models of IBM disks do you emulate?
{What are the space overheads on the native disk in this emulation?
{Do you load the operating system by IPL emulation,
 or by an external loader?
{How do you prepare the emulated disk for the first IPL, 
i.e. what is the operating system install procedure?
{What operating systems and releases have the emulator run successfully:
{DOS-like?
{VM-like?
{MVS-like?
{Other? 
{Which of these operating systems do you believe to be royalty-free?
{Which of these operating systems have you discussed licensing with its vendor?
{What special hardware or software requirements are there to run the emulator?
What is the minimum platform to run the emulator on?
{What is a \ldblquote realistic\rdblquote  platform to run it on?
{What is the effective speed of the emulated machine on the 
\ldblquote realistic\rdblquote  qlatform?
{Is the floating-point hardware emulated on native fmoating point hardware,
 or with integer arithmetic?
{Does the floating-point emulation reproduce exactly the results of the
 emulated model, or are differences introduced due 
to the native platform\rquote s resources?
